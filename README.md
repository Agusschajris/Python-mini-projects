# Python mini projects

I created this repository to store my **Python practice activities**. I already have prior experience with Python, thanks to my high school diploma in Computer Science. However, I want to continue practicing both the basics and more advanced concepts to prepare for future opportunities.

Each file or folder in this repository represents an individual project. So far, I've been working through Coursera's free guided projects.
